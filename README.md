# 👋Introduction

Hi, I’m Jules a French student in IT, currently in 3rd year of a Bachelor in Computer Science at IUT Charlemagne in Nancy.

I would like to become a back-end programmer to work on various projects.

I also like working on little projects such as my personnal portfolio (one day) or little web applications, like my AnimeDle

My personal portfolio is a work in progress, where I'm in the process of creating a showcase of my skills and projects to present my journey in the field of IT and web development

### 🌍Flucks
Flucks is a project developed as part of my IUT (Institut Universitaire de Technologie) coursework. Its aim is to facilitate live streaming, video viewing, and similar activities with geolocation features. Additionally, it incorporates an emergency mode to highlight injustices occurring in proximity to the user's location. This project is designed to address social issues and raise awareness about local events and concerns.
